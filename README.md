# DESeq2-TCGA-PAAD
This repository includes a comprehensive codebase that explains how to obtain and filter TCGA data as well as how to use DESeq2 to analyse differential expression. The data was obtained via PAAD-TCGA, and the TCGABiolink package was used to download and manipulate the data. The "Enhanced Volcano" library was used to obtain the volcano plot.
